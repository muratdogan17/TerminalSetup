My Personal terminal setup for web development.

For my terminal I use Zeit's [hyper.app](https://github.com/zeit/hyper)

** I highly reccomend that you take a look around in each config file to get an
idea of what I like to use. But I won't say you should copy it exactly, each
person's preference is totally different. Feel free to clone it and make it your
own :) **
